### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p class="spn">$169.99</p>

<button class="btn">Add to Cart</button
```
```css
.right-container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-top-right-radius: 20px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 20px;
    display: inline-block;
    /* margin: auto; */
    margin-bottom: 50px;
    margin-top: 100px;
    width: 250px;
    height: 350px;
```



### Continued development

The next code i will write i want to have improved on the the image grids well and also know how to incooporate javascript.
